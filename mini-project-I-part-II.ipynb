He is the only currently living musician to hold the Order of Merit, the highest honour that can be granted by the Jamaican government for achievement in the arts and sciences. He is best known among mainstream audiences for songs such as \"Sitting in Limbo,\" \"You Can Get It If You Really Want,\" and \"Many Rivers to Cross\" from the soundtrack to The Harder They Come, which helped popularize reggae across the world; and his covers of Cat Stevens' \"Wild World\" and Johnny Nash's \"I Can See Clearly Now\" from the film Cool Runnings. Outside of the reggae world, he is probably best known for his film appearance in The Harder They Come. Jimmy Cliff was one of five performers inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2010.\n\nDescription above from the Wikipedia article Jimmy Cliff, licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list of contributors on Wikipedia.",
