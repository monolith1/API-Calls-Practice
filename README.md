# Lighthouse Labs Mini Project I: API Calls and Data Storage

## Project Description 

This was the first major project from my time at lightlouse labs. The assignment was to use Transit For London and The Movie DB's APIs to pull particular data. I was able to take that a few steps further by formulating my own ideas for what data to pull and how to respresent it.
